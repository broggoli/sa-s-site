# sa-s_vue

This is a website project for a client who wants a simple to use buisness website.
I decided to code the front end in Vue.js because of features like routing, single page app capabilities and more.
As a simple to understand backend Wordpress is used but headless. Vue gets all the page data through WP's REST API.
